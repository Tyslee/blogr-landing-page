## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [blogr-landing-page](https://blogr-landing-page-green.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

While developing this project I wanted to have an emphasis on how the webpage would look in a mobile view. I learned how to deal with different situations regarding screen size
and how to deal with svgs.

### Continued development

I hope to keep the habit of having the mobile webpage in mind while coding and develop nice looking code that is future proof. I find that the css is a bit messy and hard to read
so I might make the switch to TailwindCSS for future projects.

## Acknowledgments

I give thanks to myself for being able to finish it and also Frontend mentor for providing all of assets and the idea!
